Out of place, where’s the time gone
Who’s whispering—nobody here, just shadows
Once there, now not, almost forgotten
Cracks in the mirror, something’s slipping through
Why’s the clock crying again
Faces without names, or maybe no faces at all
Lights flicker, but nothing ever changes
Gone before you knew it was there
It was there—no, wait, it wasn’t
Lost keys, no doors, just endless walls
Footsteps behind, but no sound follows
Remember when you forgot to remember
Shadows longer now, but no sun
Who left the door open to nowhere
Silence, louder than it should be
A breath, then gone—was it ever
Cold wind, but no trees, no leaves
The end came, but nobody noticed
Words tangled, caught in the stillness
Flicker once, then darkness forgot its place
