Something lingered there, not a thing, just a feeling, like déjà vu but less certain, almost as if it was meant to be remembered but never fully existed in the first place.
Words scatter like leaves in the wind, directionless and wild, not meant for ears but for minds that can grasp the unspoken meanings hiding between the lines of forgotten conversations.
Time stretched thin, barely holding together the moments that slip between each breath, unraveling like an old sweater until you’re left with threads and no memory of what was warm.
Footsteps on an empty road, but the sound isn’t yours, or anyone’s; it’s just the echo of a journey never taken, leading nowhere, disappearing into the quiet distance.
A color you can’t quite name, seen only in dreams, haunting the edges of memory, as if it belongs to a place you’ve never been but somehow always missed.
Silence isn’t empty, it’s full, overflowing with all the things that never were, pressing in like a fog until you’re not sure where you end and the void begins.
A song without notes, just the rhythm of a heartbeat, steady, then faltering, as if searching for a tune that’s never been played, yet somehow feels familiar in its absence.
A shadow passed, but there was no light, no form, just the idea of something crossing your mind, lingering like a word on the tip of your tongue, refusing to be spoken.
Moments blur, losing shape, as if the day forgot to end and night never bothered to arrive, leaving you somewhere in between, where time doesn’t quite know what to do.
You try to catch it, but it slips through, like sand, or water, or maybe just the thought that you could hold onto anything for longer than a passing second.
An empty room, but not really, more like the memory of a room, where the furniture was never quite in place, and the walls don’t seem to meet at the corners anymore.
Colors fade, but not from sight, from memory, like a dream slipping away the moment you wake, leaving only the impression of something bright that you can’t describe.
You reach out, but it’s not there, whatever it was, just the echo of a gesture, a memory of trying, or maybe failing, hard to tell now that it’s gone.
There was a sound, wasn’t there? Or was it just the thought of one, lingering in the back of your mind, like a note held too long, until it fades into silence.
Shapes shift, but they don’t change, like they’re caught between being and not, hovering on the edge of what you can see but never really crossing over into existence.
No beginning, no end, just the space between, where things almost happen but never quite do, leaving you wondering if they ever could, or if they were always just waiting.
A thought escapes, but it’s not clear where it goes, just that it’s no longer yours, like it found a place more fitting, somewhere it was always meant to be.
Lines blur, not just between day and night, but between then and now, like you’re stuck in a moment that forgot to end, just stretching out until it doesn’t matter anymore.
The air feels thick, but there’s no weight to it, more like the memory of something heavy, something you once carried but now can’t remember why you did.
A question lingers, not asked, not answered, just hanging there in the space between what is and what could be, waiting for someone to decide if it even needs to be spoken.
The light flickers once, twice, then settles, as if deciding whether to stay or leave, holding onto the room like a memory it can’t quite let go of.
A name whispered in the dark, too quiet to hear, too loud to ignore, leaving you wondering if it was yours, or just something you almost recognized.
The road winds on, but the destination fades, leaving only the journey, an endless loop of almost-arrivals that never quite reach where you thought you were going.
Something tugs at the edges of your thoughts, just out of reach, a feeling that maybe, just maybe, you’ve been here before, though you can’t say when or why.
The air is heavy, thick with words unspoken, thoughts unformed, as if the silence itself is waiting for someone to break it, but nobody dares to speak first.
The door creaks open, but no one steps through, just a gust of wind carrying with it the scent of something old, forgotten, yet somehow familiar.
Colors bleed into one another, blending until they’re nothing but shades of grey, as if the world itself has forgotten what it’s supposed to look like.
You reach for the light switch, but your hand stops, frozen halfway, as if unsure whether it wants to plunge the room into darkness or bring it back to life.
A whisper floats on the breeze, carrying with it the echo of a question you never asked, but somehow already know the answer to.
The shadows dance, but the light stands still, watching, waiting, as if it’s trying to decide whether to join in or simply fade away.
Time moves forward, but the past lingers, wrapping itself around your thoughts like a cloak, heavy and comforting, yet impossible to shake off.
The clock ticks, but the hands don’t move, as if they’ve forgotten what they’re supposed to be counting down to, or maybe just don’t care anymore.
The sound of laughter echoes through the empty room, but there’s no one there to laugh, just the memory of a moment that’s already slipped away.
A door opens, but there’s no room behind it, just an empty space where something should be, but isn’t, and maybe never was.
The night stretches on, but dawn never comes, leaving you stranded in the in-between, where nothing is certain, and everything feels like a half-remembered dream.
The wind whispers secrets that aren’t meant for you, but you listen anyway, hoping to catch a glimpse of something just out of reach.
The walls close in, but you don’t move, as if you’re waiting for them to make the first move, though you’re not sure what that would mean.
A flash of light, a burst of sound, then silence, as if the world itself has taken a breath and is holding it, waiting for something to happen.
The ground shifts beneath your feet, but you don’t stumble, as if you’ve grown used to the uncertainty, the constant feeling of being on the edge of something unknown.
The sky darkens, but no storm comes, just a quiet tension hanging in the air, as if the world is holding its breath, waiting for something to break.
A voice calls out, but it’s not yours, and it’s not calling for you, just a sound in the distance, fading before you can understand what it’s saying.
The sun sets, but the night doesn’t follow, leaving the world bathed in a strange twilight, where nothing is quite as it seems.
A hand reaches out, but there’s no one there to grasp it, just the empty space where a connection should be, but isn’t.
The floor creaks, but there’s no weight on it, just the echo of a step that was never taken, or maybe taken too long ago to remember.
A shadow falls, but there’s no light to cast it, just the outline of something that should be solid, but isn’t, and maybe never was.
The air hums with the promise of something more, something just out of reach, waiting for the right moment to reveal itself, or maybe just fade away.
The ground beneath you feels unsteady, like it’s not quite sure it wants to hold you up, or maybe it’s just waiting for you to fall.
A door closes, but you didn’t hear it open, just the sound of something ending before it even began, leaving you wondering what you missed.
The sky fades from blue to black, but the stars don’t come out, as if they’ve forgotten their place, or maybe just decided not to show up tonight.
A thought crosses your mind, but it’s gone before you can catch it, slipping away like water through your fingers, leaving you wondering what it was, and why it mattered.
